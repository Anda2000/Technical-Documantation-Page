            </pre>
            <p>It turns any directory into a Git repository.To initialize a repository, Git creates a hidden directory called .git. That directory stores all of the objects and refs that Git uses and creates as a part of your project's history. This hidden .git directory is what separates a regular directory from a Git repository.</p>

            <p>selects that file, and moves it to the staging area, marking it for inclusion in the next commit. You can select all files, a directory, specific files, or even specific parts of a file for staging and commit.This means if you git add a deleted file the deletion is staged for commit. The language of "add" when you're actually "deleting" can be confusing. If you think or use git stage in place of git add, the reality of what is happening may be more clear.</p>

      </pre>
       <p>It creates a commit, which is like a snapshot of your repository. These commits are snapshots of your entire repository at specific times. You should make new commits often, based around logical units of change. Over time, commits should tell a story of the history of your repository and how it came to be the way that it currently is. Commits include lots of metadata in addition to the contents and message, like the author, timestamp, and more.</p>

            </pre>
            <p>A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server. In contrast to a local repository, a remote typically does not provide a file tree of the project's current state.</p>

            <pre>
              <code class="nohighlight">$ git push origin master</code>
            </pre>
            <p>updates the remote branch with local commits. It is one of the four commands in Git that prompts interaction with the remote repository. You can also think of git push as update or publish.
      
      By default, git push only updates the corresponding branch on the remote. So, if you are checked out to the master branch when you execute git push, then only the master branch will be updated. It's always a good idea to use git status to see what branch you are on before pushing to the remote.</p>

              <code class="nohighlight">$ git pull</code>
            </pre>
            <p>It updates your current local working branch, and all of the remote tracking branches. It's a good idea to run git pull regularly on the branches you are working on locally.Without git pull, (or the effect of it,) your local branch wouldn't have any of the updates that are present on the remote.</p>

            </pre>
            <p>The git clone command is used to create a copy of a specific repository or branch within a repository.Git is a distributed version control system. Maximize the advantages of a full repository on your own machine by cloning.</p>
